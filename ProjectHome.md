App Engine Blog ("AEB", pronounced "Abe") seeks to provide a near wordpress quality blog engine that runs on the google app engine.

It is a fork of Brian M. Clapper's excellent Pico Blog for app engine.

Some core features / attributes:
- runs on app engine
- uses python and django
- fully functional password protected admin to add/edit/delete blog posts
- fully functional public blog viewer to view blog posts
- tag cloud support
- WYSIWYG editor for posts
- home page truncated article previews with read more link
- search engine friendly url's
- working to keep the code barebones and add features via integration with social media & other javascript api's for promotion/analytics/profit: feedburner rss, feedburner email, twitter follow, facebook fan follow, disqus comments, google analytics, google adsense, google custom search, wibiya toolbar, tweetmeme retweet this, and facebook share this.

Upgrades / future enhancements being considered / in progress:
- considering port to java app engine
- non ajax for now (considering adding ajax features but concerned with search engine optimization issues)
- memcache support
- image upload support
- "themelets", ie: a minimalist base ui theme that can be extended via editing a css file
- support for plugins ala wordpress
- source code auto-formatter to make it easier to share source code snippets
- there are more ideas which are eluding me at the moment, stay tuned.
